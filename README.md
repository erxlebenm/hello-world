First repository, for trying something new.

About me:

I have a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from the Ohio State University. I graduated in three years and with Honors. I have experience working in human-subjects research, and am looking to pursue a career that involves coding and statistics while still making use of my knowledge of social interactions.

This account is to help me gain experience and continue my education.
